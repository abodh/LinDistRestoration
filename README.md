LinDistRestoration is a package that solves a 3-phase unbalanced distribution system restoration problem using mixed-integer linear programming. This package is intended for users interested in solving linear optimal power flow problems. The linear power flow model is extracted from [[1]](#ref1) and the base restoration models are based on [[2]](#ref2), [[3]](#ref3).
